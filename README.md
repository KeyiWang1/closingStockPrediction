# closingStockPrediction

This model uses a Recurrent Neural Network (Long Short Term Memory) to predict the closing stock price of corperations.<br>
Uses tools like pandas, pandas_datareader, numpy, sklearn, and keras<br>

"""
DISCLAIMER:
        This is just a coding exercise and is in no way intended for use as the basis of making stock predictions.
        The model uses data from the past 60 days to predict the next day which is not practical in nature.
        A well functioning model would incorporate elements that reflect the core traits of a market prediction
        from an economic standpoint such as:
        - macroeconomic news (e.g. interest rate changes)
        - fundamental analysis (e.g. earnings release notes)
        - statistical analysis (e.g. co-integration)
        - technical analysis (e.g. moving averages)
        - market microstructure (e.g. arbitrage or trade infrastructure)
        of sentiment analysis or expert review. 
        Non of which is done by this model
