# closingStockPrediction

This model uses a Recurrent Neural Network (Long Short Term Memory) to predict the closing stock price of corperations.<br>
Uses tools like pandas, pandas_datareader, numpy, sklearn, and keras<br>

DISCLAIMER:<br>
        This is just a coding exercise and is in no way intended for use as the basis of making stock predictions.<br>
        The model uses data from the past 60 days to predict the next day which is not practical in nature.<br>
        A well functioning model would incorporate elements that reflect the core traits of a market prediction<br>
        from an economic standpoint such as:<br>
        - macroeconomic news (e.g. interest rate changes)<br>
        - fundamental analysis (e.g. earnings release notes)<br>
        - statistical analysis (e.g. co-integration)<br>
        - technical analysis (e.g. moving averages)<br>
        - market microstructure (e.g. arbitrage or trade infrastructure)<br>
        of sentiment analysis or expert review. <br>
        Most of which are not yet incorperated in this model<br>
